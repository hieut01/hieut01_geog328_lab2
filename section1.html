    <h2>The Early Days of Stats</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Points</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Rebounds</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Assists</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Field Goal Percentage</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These numbers were usually written by hand and printed in newspapers. Coaches mostly looked at who scored the most points, not how they played overall. For example, someone could score 25 points but take a ton of bad shots to get there. Later, people realized that being efficient, making more of your shots and helping the team win, was more important than just scoring a lot.</p>
